                    Right Stuf Acquired By Crunchyroll
                </div>
                <div class="news-piece">
                    A year after it was acquired by Sony Corporation’s (NYSE: <a href="">SONY</a>) FUNimation
                    Entertainment Ltd, anime
                    streaming giant Crunchyroll <a href="">announced</a> that it has acquired anime merchandise retailer
                    Right Stuf,
                    Inc for an undisclosed sum. The move represents a large consolidating move by Sony, though
                    Crunchyroll said it will continue to stock releases from other North American distributors. Right
                    Stuf is the largest retailer of anime, manga, and related merchandise in North America. Earlier this
                    year Sony merged FUNimation’s and Crunchyroll’s streaming catalogs into one service; the acquisition
                    of Right Stuf signals a move to become a one-stop shop for anime fans to buy and stream from. Anime
                    has exploded in popularity internationally over the past five years, going from a minor subculture
                    to a major cultural phenomenon with an estimated market of almost <span class="bold-highlight">$25
                        billion</span>.

                    Lemonade (NYSE: <a href="">LMND</a>), the artificial intelligence-powered insurance company, <a

                    closed the acquisition of car insurance provider Metromile, Inc. (NASDAQ: <a href="">MILE</a>). San
                    Francisco-based
                    Metromile offers pay-per-mile car insurance and licenses its digital insurance platform to other
                    insurance companies. The company went public via a special purpose acquisition company in February
                    2021 at a valuation of <span class="bold-highlight">$1 billion</span>, but its valuation dropped to
                    <span class="bold-highlight">$137 million</span> after the deal closed.
                    For Lemonade, which launched its own insurance product just a few months ago, the acquisition of
                    Metromile’s sensor and monitor technologies along with billions of miles of driving data and
                    hundreds of thousands of claims data will make its Lemonade Car platform “the most competitive,
                    precise, and fair.”

                Boeing Co, FedEx Corp, and MotoGP, among others. Apollo sees the acquisition as an opportunity to
                capitalize on the market demand for air-cargo services as the needs of the global supply chain grow. The
                deal is expected to close in Q4 2022 or Q1 2023, pending regulatory approval. After closing AAWW will be
                delisted and become a privately held company.

                Canadian banking firm Toronto Dominion Bank (TD) announced that it plans to acquire New York-based

                    billion</span>. TD has been looking to expand its market
                reach beyond Canada in recent years and the acquisition is expected to help diversify the firm’s
                capital-markets business in the United States, though analysts warn that the integration of Cowen could
                cause headaches due to management and cultural differences between the two companies. Funds for Cowen
                will be procured through the sale of shares from TD’s Charles Schwab investment services firm. The Cowen
                deal is TD’s second this year and is expected to close in Q1 2023.

                Estée Lauder In Talks To Buy Tom Ford
            </div>
            <div class="news-piece">
                According to the <a href="">Wall Street Journal</a>, cosmetics giant Estée Lauder Cos (NYSE: <a
                    href="">EL</a>) is in talks to acquire
                luxury fashion brand Tom Ford in a deal potentially worth <span class="bold-highlight">$3
                    billion</span>. Bloomberg first reported in early
                July that Tom Ford was for sale. Per people familiar with the matter, there are no indications that an
                agreement could be reached at this juncture, as Estée Lauder isn’t the only suitor. Though known for its
                menswear, Tom Ford also sells womenswear and accessories, as well as a fast-growing, high-end line of
                cosmetics and fragrances. Estée Lauder is particularly interested in its beauty business and the two
                companies already have a long standing licensing deal. If successful the deal will become Estée Lauder’s
                biggest acquisition to date, following the company’s announced $2.2 billion acquisition of <a
                    href="">Deciem</a> in
                2021.

                Signify Health Exploring Alternatives

            <div class="news-piece">
                According to the <a href="">Wall Street Journal</a>, Signify Health Inc. (NYSE: <a href="">SGFY</a>) is
                working with investment
                bankers to explore strategic alternatives including a sale, less than 2 years after its initial public
                offering. Founded in 2017, Signify Health is a healthcare-services company that supplies technology
                solutions for in-home care health plans and providers. After raising $500 million from its IPO in early
                2021, the company’s stock has fallen 25% since then, and it has announced in July that it plans to close
                one of its units after recent changes to a government payment model. Per people familiar with the
                matter, a deal is still far from guaranteed, and the company could attract offers from different managed
                care plans and private equity groups. New York-based private-equity firm New Mountain Capital has been
                an investor since 2017.

                Penguin-Simon & Schuster Merger Trial Begins
            </div>
            <div class="news-piece">
                The <a href="">proposed merger</a> between publishing houses Penguin Random House LLC and Simon &
                Schuster, Inc. is in
                court this week as the Department of Justice is suing to stop what it argues is a monopolizing move in
                an industry already dominated by a few major players. Penguin and Simon & Schuster argue that the merger
                will help “enhance” competition among publishers and force them to compete harder for hot titles. The
                trial is expected to last through the middle of this month, with a final verdict announced by November.
                Simon & Schuster’s parent company, Paramount Global (NASDAQ: <a href="">PARA</a>) has been looking to
                offload the
                publisher and may wind up selling it to private investors if the merger is blocked.

                Pepsi Invests In Celsius

            <div class="news-piece">
                PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: <a href="">PEP</a>) announced that it has made a <span

                in energy drink maker Celsius Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: <a href="">CELH</a>) as part of a long-term
                distribution deal.
                Founded in 2004, Celsius offers sugar-free and caffeinated sparkling beverages, and markets itself as a
                healthy alternative to diet sodas and other energy drinks. The company experienced explosive growth and
                gained name recognition during the pandemic with its successful social media marketing on TikTok and
                Instagram. <a href="">Energy drinks</a> are one of the fastest growing categories in the non-alcoholic
                beverage
                segment, and this deal would strengthen Pepsi’s presence in this category. In early 2020, Pepsi bought
                legacy energy drink maker <a href="">Rockstar</a> for $3.85 billion.
